### About Me

#### Work Experience
I’m currently a working student specializing in Python development at Wuthold und Braun. I've gained extensive experience with web tools like Django (Python framework) and PostgreSQL databases. Driven by a deep interest in AI, I've led digital transformation initiatives at my company using Python libraries like Pandas, automating tasks in bookkeeping.

Outside of my professional role, I have also assisted freelancers and small businesses in establishing their online presence with custom websites and Google SEO.

#### Education
As I enter the final year of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and AI, I am focusing on gaining a deeper understanding of AI concepts such as Natural Language Processing, Neural Networks, and Large Language Models.
